;;; Commentary:

;; A node to perform DNS lookup using the 'host' shell-call.  The node
;; takes one input that is used as an enable signal.  When new data is
;; present on the input a new DNS lookup is executed.  The node has two
;; configuration parameters.  The first is the host where the query
;; should be executed, the second the name or IP address that should
;; be looked up.  The node has one output that conveys the result of
;; the query.
